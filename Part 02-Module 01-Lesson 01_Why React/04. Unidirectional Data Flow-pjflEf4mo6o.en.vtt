00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Before react.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.505
One popular technique for managing state changes in an app over time,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.210
was to use data bindings,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.705
so that when data changes in one place,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.655
that changes automatically reflected in other places in the app.

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:17.140
Any part of the app that had that data could also change it.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.810
But, as the app grows this technique makes it difficult to determine how a change in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.805
one place automatically and implicitly affects the rest of the app.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:29.700
React uses an explicit method for passing data between

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.840
components that makes it a lot easier to track changes to the state,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540
and how they affect other places of the app.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.300
This is called unidirectional data flow because

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.330
the data flows one way from parent elements down to children.
