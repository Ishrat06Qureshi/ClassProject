00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.855
You'll notice that as we get deeper into this course,

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.873
the API you need to learn for React,

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:06.775
is actually pretty small.

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:11.010
React doesn't like to recreate functionality that you can already do in JavaScript.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.640
For example, if you want to create a bunch of list items and show them to the view,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.385
in React, you just use JavaScript spilt and map method.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.152
You'll see more examples of this throughout the course,

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:25.590
but know that if you already feel comfortable with JavaScript,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.945
you'll quickly feel comfortable with React.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:29.895
And as a bonus,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.190
if you're not quite comfortable with JavaScript,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.120
React will make you a much better JavaScript developer.
