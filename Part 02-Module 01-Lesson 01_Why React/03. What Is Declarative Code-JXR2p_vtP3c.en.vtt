00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
One of the key concepts in React is writing declarative code.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.710
You may have heard people talk about imperative versus declarative code.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.960
I hope to explain the difference clearly with

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.420
something you've probably already experienced.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.875
Consider I'm in my car and I want to keep the temperature somewhere comfortable.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.635
Maybe that's around 71 degrees.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.215
My car has two knobs to reach that state.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.295
A knob that controls the temperature and one that controls the airflow.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.770
When it gets too hot or too cold,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.690
I have to do imperative work.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.745
I have to manage these knobs the entire drive.

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:35.645
I accumulate over time,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:40.550
this state of 71 degrees but I never actually talked about that state.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.295
Now, let's consider I got a new car.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.755
It doesn't have these knobs for climate control.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.770
Instead, it lets me declare a temperature.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.420
Instead of fiddling around with the knobs over the course of my drive to get 71 degrees,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.955
I just tell the car the state I want to be in,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:01:00.665
I set the temperature to 71 degrees and it handles the imperative work for me.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.410
React lets you do the same thing with your code.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.020
You declare state and markup and react does

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.650
the imperative work of keeping the dom in sync with your app
