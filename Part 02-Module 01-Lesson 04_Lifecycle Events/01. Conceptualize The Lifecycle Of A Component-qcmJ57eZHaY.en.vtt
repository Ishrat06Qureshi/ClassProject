00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
At this point, you should be fairly comfortable

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.190
dealing with local state inside of your components.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.070
However, one thing we haven't talked about yet is how

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.395
to fetch and manage data that is living in a database somewhere.

00:00:11.395 --> 00:00:15.720
Your first intuition might be to make an Ajax request inside of the render method.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.090
Unfortunately, that's a bad idea because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.680
the render method needs to be free of side effects.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.700
It shouldn't make Ajax requests or do anything that is asynchronous in nature.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.580
It should only receive props and return a description of the UI.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.748
So, if we can't make Ajax requests in the render method,

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:33.545
where should we make them?

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.335
This introduces the concept of lifecycle events in react.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.460
Lifecycle events are special methods each component has that allow

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.675
us to run custom behavior during certain times of the components life.

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:49.380
Times like when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.110
when a component receives no props, and a few others.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.195
React has a bunch of different life cycle events that you could hook into, but for now,

00:00:57.195 --> 00:01:00.170
we're only going to talk about the most common ones.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.655
First, is componentDidMount.

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:07.295
It's immediately invoked after the component is inserted into the DOM.

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:09.810
Then comes componentWillUnmount which is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.840
invoked immediately before a component is removed from the DOM,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.260
and last is get derived state from props which will

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.370
be invoked whenever the component is about to receive brand new props.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.900
Now, I realized this is a lot of information to remember.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.835
Don't get overwhelmed thinking you need to memorize all of them.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.600
Instead, try to remember that they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.990
exist and then look up the documentation when you need them.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.660
Now, we still have to answer the initial question.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.610
If we want it to fetch external data from an API,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.330
how do we do this?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.530
This is the perfect use case for the componentDidMount lifecycle event.
