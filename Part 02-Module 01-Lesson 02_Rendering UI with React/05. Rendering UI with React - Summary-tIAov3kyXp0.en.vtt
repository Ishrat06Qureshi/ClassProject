00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
The principles we've discussed in this lesson are

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.075
absolutely fundamental to getting the most out of a React.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:11.100
Just to recap, we learned about how JSX just uses JavaScript to let us

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.310
describe the UI by creating elements instead of writing these rigid string templates.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.470
We also learned how to encapsulate groups of elements in React components,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.570
and how to build larger portions of the UI by composing those components together.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.970
We also installed create React App,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.180
and used it to get a quick start on using the latest technologies

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.990
commonly used to create a modern React application.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.520
But React's code we use in encapsulation story gets really interesting in

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780
the next lesson where we could talk about how each of these little components can hold,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.230
and manage it's own state
