00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.755
Now that we've learned how to create elements and how to nest them,

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.690
it can get pretty tedious if we're just using these nested

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.665
create element calls to create large portions of our app.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:13.440
If only we had a different syntax we could use to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.095
describe nested relationships of elements in a natural way.

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:19.570
Well, what about HTML?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.535
Isn't that what it's used for?

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:22.680
What if we could borrow some of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.370
the sweet angle brackets and put them right in our JavaScript?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.213
In other words, what if we can make or create element calls look a little more like HTML,

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:33.805
which we're already familiar with?

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:36.110
This is exactly what JSX does.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.255
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript,

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:43.290
that lets us write JavaScript code that looks a little bit more like HTML,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.000
making it more concise and easier to follow. Let's check it out.
