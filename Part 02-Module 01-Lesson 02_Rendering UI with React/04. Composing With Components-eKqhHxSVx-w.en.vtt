00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Earlier, I said that components are the building blocks of React.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.344
But what do I actually mean by that?

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:10.995
If you look at the API and documentation for React, they're relatively small.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.894
The vast majority of React's API is all about components.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:18.465
They are the main unit of encapsulation that React gives us.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:23.340
Components are great, because they help us break down the UI into smaller pieces.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.870
These pieces have clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.450
This is valuable when building a large app,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.550
because it lets us work on tiny pieces of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.760
the app without inadvertently affecting the rest of it.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.949
Another great thing about components,

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.515
is that they encourage us to build applications using composition instead of inheritance.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:46.830
Let's take a look at what I mean when I say composition.
