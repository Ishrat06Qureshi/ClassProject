00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Okay. So, it looks like our app was created successfully,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.940
and we have a bunch of instructions here that tell

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.790
us how to run things and how to build it.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.430
I love the level of detail that Create React app gives you.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.020
There are good instructions all over the code base in the comments,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.695
and all of the different files.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.190
So, I would encourage you to go poking around in there.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.410
For now, we're just going to follow

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.455
the instructions here for starting our development server.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.530
So, go into the context directory,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.965
and you could run yarn start.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:32.835
Now when we run yarn start,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.300
Create React app is automatically going to open a browser window

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.530
with the app running right there in the browser. That's pretty cool.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.855
It says to get started,

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:46.000
edit src/App.js and save it to reload.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.315
So, in our editor, let's open src/App.js.

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.270
And now, we can see the code that is running right there in the browser.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.855
This code should look pretty familiar to some stuff that we've done up until this point.

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:00.460
We have an app component,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.300
which is rendering a div.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.735
That div is rendering a child,

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:08.250
an element, as well as a paragraph element.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
But remember that none of these are strings.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
We know already from our previous work that every single one of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.460
these elements is created through a function call to create element.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.415
That GSX is just the syntax that helps us to express that a little more concisely.

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:29.565
One of the really cool things about Create React app is that it

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:33.540
automatically gives us the auto reload behavior that we saw before.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.270
So for example, we could edit this header,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.405
and we can say, "Hello World".

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:42.930
If we save it, our browser is automatically going to refresh,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.935
and show those changes.

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:49.620
One thing that we don't see in this file is any reference to ReactDOM,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.740
or how this DOM is actually getting into the page.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.280
For that, we're going to have to look at the project a little bit more.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.980
So, if we pop open the file browser here,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.805
we can see that App.js is in the source directory.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:06.255
But how is app actually making it into the page?

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:11.185
In order to find that, open up src/index.js.

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:14.075
So, this call should look familiar to you.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.370
index.js imports app from the app file,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.380
and renders the app into the root element that is already in the document.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.030
Similarly, you might be wondering where the root element is coming from.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.515
Well, for that, what you can do,

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.750
is open up public/index.html.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.025
And here you could see the html document that all of this JavaScript is running it.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:41.050
So here is our div right here, our root element.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.475
When we run our build,

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:46.350
what PAC is going to generate a bundle with all of our JavaScript,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.755
and put a script tag in the page right after this div.

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.610
So, that's how it all comes together.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.930
If you want to learn more about how Create React app works,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.115
I'd recommend checking out the "Read me" which contains instructions,

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:01.583
and detailed guides about how to use it,

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:05.090
and how to modify it to suit your specific needs.
