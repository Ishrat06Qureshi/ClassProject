00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
Now let's say that we want to give our element a class.

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:09.320
This second argument here is for properties that we want to give to our DOM node.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.065
So, let's give it a class of welcome-message, and we'll save this.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.540
Then you'll notice here that we get a warning here in the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.705
console," Invalid DOM property 'class'.

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:21.500
Did you mean 'className'?".

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.920
This is a warning that React is giving us.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.163
It's saying that the word 'class' is not actually a valid DOM property,

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:31.450
it's suggesting that we use className instead.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.303
So, let's try that.

00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:35.680
Now, we can see that the warning is gone.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.065
The element, if we look here in the console,

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.910
has the class that we expect.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.800
Well, that's a little confusing,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.730
but it's not if you remember that these elements actually describe DOM nodes, not HTML.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.185
'Class' is the name of the HTML attribute.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.755
Once the browser parses it and turns it into a real DOM node,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.770
the DOM property name is className.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.855
Let's inspect this div in the console.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.225
So, here I have this div in the console.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:06.610
You'll see that though its HTML representation has the word 'class',

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.882
if I say div.class,

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:10.123
here I'm using the object,

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:14.975
the actual DOM node div.class is undefined,

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.724
but div.className is the string that we would expect.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.275
So when we're creating these React elements,

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:26.050
you always have to remember that you're describing DOM nodes, not HTML strings.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.770
When learning about React,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.620
you might have come across the term 'Virtual DOM'.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.686
What the term means is that these aren't real DOM elements that we're creating here.

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:39.470
Instead, these are objects that describe real DOM nodes.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.455
So when we call react.create element,

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.500
we haven't actually created anything in the DOM yet,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.404
it's not until we say render,

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:50.400
that the browser actually creates a real DOM element
