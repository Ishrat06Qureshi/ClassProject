00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Digging in and are wrestling with material is crucial to gaining

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.000
a deep understanding of that material and retaining it in your long term memory.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.530
Research shows that we gain a deeper understanding of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.675
what we've learned when we explain it to someone else.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.190
After learning a concept and before going to the next lecture,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.275
try summarizing that concept in your head.

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:23.225
Imagine that you're trying to explain it to someone else.

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.670
Or better yet, go and actually explain it to someone.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
You can do this in person or on a video call with a friend or in your friendly community.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.810
To help strengthen the connections in your brain and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.515
improve both understanding and retention,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.440
ask yourself follow up questions about the material. Here's an example.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.690
If I changed X in the example,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.430
would the code still work?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.356
How would it change? Connect new information to something you already know.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:52.320
In which way are the two similar or how are they different?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.814
You can actually draw out the information in a visual form.

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:58.080
Shergar diagrams, visual models or flowcharts.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.690
These strategies will help you accomplish three things.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.255
They'll help you gain a deeper understanding of the material,

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:04.680
they'll help your classmates learn

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.650
the material and you'll actually have a lot of fun doing them.
