00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
Maintaining a growth mindset is crucial in any learning endeavor,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.640
and it's no different here.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.086
This program is hard and it will require you to not only manage your time effectively,

00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:12.045
but also to go beyond your comfort zone,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.880
ask questions, and continually challenge yourself.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
Remember that it often takes multiple attempts to pass a project.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.599
It also takes time to really understand the new concept.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.045
It may seem like you're the only one who's having trouble,

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.550
but I guarantee you that that's not the case.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.360
I had trouble with this content when I started learning it,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.570
and I want to encourage you to keep going.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.010
Try different learning tactic,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.140
use the available mentorship resources,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.885
and take advantage of your amazing slack community.

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:39.618
We're all here to support you,

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:43.360
and we're excited to have the opportunity to help you accomplish your goals.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.670
Not passing a project or not understanding

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.375
the content after reviewing it several times is not failure.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:52.015
It's an opportunity to really challenge yourself.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:54.520
With each attempt, you're closer to passing.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.594
With each attempt, you're closer to mastering this content.

00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:00.910
With each attempt, you're closer to achieving your goal.
