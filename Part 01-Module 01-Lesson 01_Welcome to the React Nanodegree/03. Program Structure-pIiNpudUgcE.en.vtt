00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Hi. Welcome to the React Nanodegree program.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.860
We're so glad you're here.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.295
My name is Richard, and I'm the curriculum lead for this program.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.925
We've designed the program to be four months long to accommodate your schedule,

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:16.160
while helping you become a professional React developer as quickly as possible.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.210
You won't be going through this program alone.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.840
You'll be learning as part of a community of like-minded individuals,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.270
who will be challenging and supporting you every step of

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.835
the way as you work toward a common goal.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.115
If you haven't already, join the slack community

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.905
at the link below and say hi to your fellow colleagues.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.460
Okey. Let's talk briefly about what the road ahead looks like.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
The program is made up of three main courses and some elective courses.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.505
At the end of each main course,

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:43.530
you'll build and submit a project.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.754
To help you manage your time in each course,

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.130
gauge your progress and make sure you get the most out of the program.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.080
Each project has a deadline.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.875
Now, deadlines can sound scary,

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.320
but their purpose is to be an effective tool to help you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.300
finish the program and achieve your career goals.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.960
You just need to keep them in the back of your mind as you progress through

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.785
the course and build in some buffer time for a project planning,

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.915
debugging, and other things that may come up.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:12.235
Building an extra buffer time will help you be less stressed out and remain on track.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:14.430
If you're learning React for the first time,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.920
if you've worked with React before and want to dig deeper,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.587
or if you're somewhere in-between,

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:22.710
we're glad to have you. Welcome to the program.
