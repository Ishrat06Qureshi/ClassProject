00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
In the last video where we left off was we created our ListContacts component.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:09.520
We parsed to it our contacts array as

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.870
a prop and then inside of ListContacts we had an ordered list,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.610
but we haven't done anything inside of it yet.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.370
All we have done is we are console.logging,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.020
whatever the step props is,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.670
which you'll see inside of the console has a contacts property on the props object,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.770
that has three different contacts.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.300
So, now what we can do is we can use JavaScript to map

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.695
over our contacts array and for each item inside of contacts,

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:40.330
we can create a list item to show the specific contact to the view.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.655
So, what we will do in order to do that,

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.374
is let's first delete this console.log.

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:51.649
And now inside of our ol list we'll go into JavaScript by doing the curly braces.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.580
We will then say, this.props.contacts.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.695
We want to map over those,

00:00:57.695 --> 00:00:59.450
we'll have an arrow function here.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.510
Notice, I'm using parens rather than

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.085
curly braces to get the implicit return of the ES6 error function.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.940
So, for each contact what we now want to do is we want to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.900
create a list item here that says, contact.name.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.130
And now what we've done is inside of our UI,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.600
we have three different items,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.432
each item represents the name of an individual contact.

00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:27.509
And if you remember looking at our console we have an error here,

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.285
each child in an array or iterator should have a unique key prop.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.905
So, what we need to do is we can come and give this a unique key prop.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:39.655
If you remember back to what our contacts array looks like,

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:42.160
is each contact has an ID,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.425
a name, a handle and an avatar URL.

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:48.718
So, what we will use is this ID property as the unique ID.

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:51.490
So we can come in here and say, contact.id.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.775
The reason we need to do this,

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:58.105
is because eventually one of those list items may change.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.465
And by having a unique key attribute on each list item,

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:05.815
React is able to performantly know which items in the list has changed,

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:08.740
rather than recreating the entire list every time.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.990
So now, if we save this,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.649
what we should see is that we have our list and that error goes away.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.025
And now when we save that we still get our same list,

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.140
but we no longer get that error in the console
