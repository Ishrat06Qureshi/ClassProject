00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
At this point, you've learned about creating components,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.080
composing components together, and passing data to components.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.600
However, we still haven't talked about what may be

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.555
the best part of React, state management.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.735
Because of React's component model,

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:20.190
we're able to encapsulate the complexity of state management to individual components.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.660
This allows us to build

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.725
a large application by building out a bunch of smaller applications,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.675
which are really just components.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:29.805
To add state to our components,

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:35.235
all we need to do is add a state property to our class whose value is an object.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.430
This object represents the state of our component.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.140
Each key in the object,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.215
represents a distinct piece of state for this component.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.840
Now, just as we did with props,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.680
we can access the username property on our state by doing this,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
dot state dot username.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.170
What I really love about React is how it allows my brain

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.605
to separate two important, yet complex concepts.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.890
First, how the component looks and second,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.065
the current state of my application.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:06.000
Because of the separation,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.340
the UI or how the application looks is simply a function of the application state.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.160
With React your two concerns are,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.060
which state in my application and how does my UI change based off of that state.
