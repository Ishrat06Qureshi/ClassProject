00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
Now that we have state inside of our application,

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:05.860
the next step is to figure out how to update it.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.970
Your natural intuition might be to update the state directly.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.635
Unfortunately, that's not going to work.

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.670
The reason is because by mutating the state directly,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.255
React will have no idea that the state of your component actually changed.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:19.915
To solve this problem,

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.740
React gives you a helper method called setState.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.090
There are two ways to use setState.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.190
The first way is by passing setState a function.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.845
The function will be passed the previous state as its first argument.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.245
The object return from this function,

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:38.680
will be merged with the current state to form the new state of the component.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.185
Instead of passing setState a function,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.025
the second pattern is to pass an object.

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:49.410
This object will be merged with the current state to form the new state of the component.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.380
Typically, you want to use the functional setState when

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.705
the new state of your component depends on the previous state.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:57.030
And for everything else,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.980
you can use the object setState.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.110
However, I always prefer to use the functional setState.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.725
But regardless of how you use setState,

00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:06.795
the end result will always be the same.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.745
Whenever you invoke setState,

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:14.670
React by default is going to re-render your entire application and update the UI.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.447
This is why we say that in React,

00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:19.285
your UI is just a function of your state.

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:20.625
Once your state changes,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.440
your UI will automatically update accordingly.
