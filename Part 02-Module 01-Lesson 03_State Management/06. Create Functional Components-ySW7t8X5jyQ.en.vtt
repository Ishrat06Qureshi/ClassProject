00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Up until this point,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.390
we've used JavaScript's class syntax with a render method to build out our components.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.010
Eventually, we'll be adding more methods to these classes, but for now,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.325
it's good to know that if all your component has is a render method,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.150
you can actually just use a regular old function to create your component.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.000
Notice however, that we're no longer

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
accessing the component's props by using the this keyword.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.060
Instead, our functional component is being

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.490
passed it's props as the first argument to the function.
