00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
So now, let's refactor our list contacts component from a component

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.890
extending the component property on the react object to a stateless functional component.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.140
So, first what we'll do is let's create a function here.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.629
We will call it the same name as our old component, ListContacts.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.570
And just as with the other component,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.840
we are going to return some UI.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.900
Let's go and copy all of this which again is just coming from the render method.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.995
Now, we can paste that into our return statement here,

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.665
and we will fix the indention real quick.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:38.100
Then now instead of accessing everything

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.180
from this keyword as you see over here inside the error message,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.490
we want to grab everything coming from

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.170
the props object that is being passed to our ListContacts component.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.350
So, as I mentioned, instead of the stop props,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.475
we can access our contacts by doing props dot contacts.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.850
In the past, I've mentioned that you can use the same intuitions for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.720
creating React components as you do normal JavaScript functions.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.470
Well, now that statement is pretty literal because you can have

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.075
actual JavaScript functions return you some JSX.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.360
And now that we are using a stateless functional component,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.615
we no longer need to import component up here,

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.400
so we can delete this section as well.
