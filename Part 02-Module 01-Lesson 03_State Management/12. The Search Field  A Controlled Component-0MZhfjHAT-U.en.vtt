00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
Here we have our final project, again.

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:04.530
And what we're going to do in this video is we are going to

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.855
build out this section right here,

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:08.445
our search contact section.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.745
And eventually what that's going to allow us to do,

00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:13.515
is that's going to allow us to filter our list,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.735
which introduces the topic of forms in React.

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:19.890
There is actually a few different ways that you could think about forms in React.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.440
The first way is to bypass components stay completely,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.170
and have your input filled right directly to the DOM,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.290
and whatever you want to get a specific value from your input field,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.975
you crap that from the DOM.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.910
Now, that's the typical way that you would do it.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.945
But if you think about the idea of React,

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.205
React is really good at managing state.

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.600
So a lot of times, it makes states who also put your form state,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
inside of your components state.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.800
So what we're going to do in this video,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.148
is we are going to bind our input field,

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:49.535
to whatever the value of a certain property on our state is.

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.255
And what that's going to do,

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:53.925
is that's going to allow us to update the UI,

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.219
based on this form data.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.560
So here, if I come and type a t,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.880
you'll notice that we are filtering our list,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.360
but we're also showing this section right here.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.785
So a good rule of thumb is,

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.488
if you want your form data to update the UI in

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:11.055
any other way besides just updating the input field itself,

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:14.076
then go ahead and make your form what's called a controlled component where

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.920
React as controlling the state of the simple field.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.545
But if you're not worried about having your UI based off the form data,

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.800
then you can go ahead and just stick this form data in the DOM somewhere,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.755
and you can grab it when you need it.

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:31.965
So we can see this in action by looking at the React developer tools.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.460
This is just a Chrome extension that you can get in the Google Chrome store,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.110
but what it allows us to do,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.945
is it allows us to view our app as a tree structure,

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:42.210
and what's even nicer, it allows us to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.960
see certain props and certain state of a component.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.730
So here we have our list contacts component.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.800
You'll notice that we are receiving these two props,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.955
then we also have this query history.

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:53.910
So if I come in here and type t,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.180
you'll notice that our state updates.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.750
But what's happening here,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.585
is that our UI is updating based off of the state.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.660
So as I mentioned, what we're going to do in this video,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.885
is we were going to bind this input field to the state.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.830
Now that's a little bit backwards because what you would expect to have happen,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.750
is you'd expect to bind the value of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.650
this query property of the state, to our input field.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.355
But what's really happening,

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:22.080
is the input value is going to be whatever state dot query is.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.315
So what we're going to do, is in order to update our input field,

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:27.285
is we need to update our state.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.370
So it's not super intuitive right now,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.260
but again, what that allows us to do,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.710
is by having our input field state living inside of a component,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.040
we can go ahead and update our UI based on that state.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.135
So let's go ahead and see how that works.

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:42.520
So as I mentioned, we're going to be adding state to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.575
our list contacts component because we're going to bind the input field,

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:49.710
that we're going to eventually build to our component states.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.395
So what we'll need to do, is refactor from using

00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:55.990
a stateless functional component to a class component.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.505
So we come in here, and go back to what we had earlier,

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:01.455
which was extending component.

00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:07.870
And then we can move all of this UI into our render method here.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.185
And then the last update we need to make as far as transforming to a class component,

00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:17.040
is let's add a property to our class.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.110
And this will also show you how to add proptypes to a class.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.035
All we need to do is add

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:27.800
a static proptypes property on our class which is the same object.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.140
So now we've updated from a stateless functional component to a class component.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.060
The next thing we need to do is instead of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.240
accessing our props from just the props object,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.230
we need to access it from this,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.805
the instance of the component.props.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:46.499
So now our app is back to normal.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:51.465
So first, let's add a property to our component state object here.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:52.560
And we will just say query,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.530
and we'll set it equal to an empty string.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.860
And then what we want to do is,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.915
we actually want to build out that input field.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:02.805
So what we will do, is let's wrap everything inside of this div,

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.790
which we will give a class name of list contacts.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.585
So let's throw our unordered list,

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:13.390
or our ordered list inside of this div.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.330
And then now what we can do,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.955
is let's build out our input field here.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:22.585
So this is going to go inside of a div,

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:26.770
we'll give it a class name of list-contacts top.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.575
And then now we get to build out this input field.

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:32.617
So what we'll have is a normal input field.

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:36.075
We'll give it a class name of search contacts,

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.245
a type of text,

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.410
placeholder will be search contacts.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.330
So this should all look normal to you so far.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.980
But now what we want to do,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.040
is we want to add two new properties to this value,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.010
as well as on change.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.135
So what we want the value again of this input field to be,

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:57.380
is whatever this.state.query is.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.690
And then now what we need to do,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.020
is we need to figure out a way to whenever the input field changes,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.200
we want to update the query property on our state,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.010
because then that will update the value inside of the input field.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.165
So what we can do, is let's add an update query method up here,

00:05:13.165 --> 00:05:15.490
which will take in the query.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.715
And then in order to update the state, what we can do,

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:20.800
is we'll call set states,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.170
and query will be the query that's being passed in,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.315
and then we will just call.trim on it.

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:29.020
And so now, when on change is invoked,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.500
what we want to do is invoke this arrow function which will pass the event.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.180
And then we want to invoke our update query method,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.595
passing it the specific input,

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:46.740
or the specific value in the input field which we can get by saying event.target.value.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.575
So now that we have our input field,

00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:50.480
in order to see what our state is,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.915
what we can do is let's come in our render method,

00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:58.120
and we will call JSON.stringify passing it the start state.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.890
So now we have this query property right here,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.595
it's set to an empty string because that was what we had.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:08.040
The default value be here inside of the state property,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.385
and now as we type into here,

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:13.790
you'll notice that what's happening is we

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.405
are updating this state based on whatever is in the input field.

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:19.460
So what we will do in the next video,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.650
is we will show how we can filter our list now,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.470
based on this input field.
