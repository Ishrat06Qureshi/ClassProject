00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
In this video what we are going to do is we are

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.925
going to build out this section right here.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.850
So, where our code is at currently is you should

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.495
have created an icons folder with these different icons.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:17.405
You should have also created a utils folder that has our contacts API file inside of it.

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:20.475
And then now what I've done is I have pasted in

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.870
a array of three different contacts that you should

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.275
have got from the previous text section.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.785
So, you'll notice each contact has an ID,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.415
a name, a handle,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.610
as well as an avatar URL.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.455
Now, what the goal of this video is as I mentioned,

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:41.075
is we want to create a brand new component which is going to take in this array as props.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.860
It will then be responsible for looping over that array.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.505
And then for each item in the array,

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.270
it's going to show a brand new contact.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.685
So, what we'll do whenever we want to build out a new component,

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.360
we can build up a new file.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.943
So, inside of our source folder here,

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:57.490
let's make a new file,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.750
and we will call it ListContacts.js because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.400
this file is going to be responsible for listing all of the contacts.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.425
So, the very first thing we need to do is we need to grab two things.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.925
React which is obviously the React library,

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:14.760
and component which is what we're going to be

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
extending to actually build our brand new React component.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.470
So, both of those are going to be coming from the React package.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.160
And then now, we can build a new component by having

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.110
a class which is going to extend component.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.150
And now what I usually do after I create my class so I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.540
don't forget is I come down here and export it.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.050
So typically, whenever we create a new module or a new file here,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.580
if we're creating a component,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.660
that component should probably be the default export.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.098
And so, now that we have our class or our components and we are exporting it.

00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:53.150
The next thing we want to do is we want to describe how this component looks.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.525
So, what we can do is we can use

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.635
the render method because that's exactly what the render method is for.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:02.700
The render method describes the UI of our component.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.420
So, what we want to return or what

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.980
the UI should look like for this component is it's going

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.130
to be an ordered list with a class name of contact list.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.560
So, now that we have our component and then we are

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.673
exporting that as the default export from this module,

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.415
the next question we need to answer is how do we actually get

00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:28.095
our contact's array down to our ListContacts component?

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.750
Because remember that's the whole goal of ListContacts.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.430
This is going to take in that array,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.848
and then for each item in the array it's going to show that was the item to the view.

00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:39.810
Well, what we can do is we can pass in contacts as

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.845
a prop when we create the ListContacts element.

00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:48.285
So, what we'll do first is let's go ahead and import our component here by saying,

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:53.329
import ListContacts from the ListContacts module that we just barely made.

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.572
Then now as I mentioned,

00:02:55.572 --> 00:03:00.645
when we create this ListContacts element which we can do with this syntax right here,

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:06.090
what we can do is we can pass a contacts prop down to ListContacts,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.695
whose value is just going to be our contacts array.

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:13.705
So, you could think of this as you would in normal function in location.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.350
So, in order for you to get data to a function,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.552
what you need to do is you need to pass that data as an argument

00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:22.890
when you invoke the function and it's similar with components.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.320
In order for you to get data to a component,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.510
what you do is you pass that data in as a prop when you create the component element.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.960
So, now we can do is inside of ListContact,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.717
in order for us to see what data we're passing in as props,

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:41.715
we can come in here and console log this up props.

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:43.830
And then if we open up the console,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.985
you'll notice that we have a contacts property on our props object,

00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:50.400
which has three contacts on it.
