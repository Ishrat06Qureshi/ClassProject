00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
So, now that we have a browser router listening to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.435
the address bar wrapped around the main app component,

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:12.120
let's go and update our link on the ListContacts or in the ListContacts component.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.220
So, if you remember we have this link over here to a new page when we create a contact.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.850
So, first let's go ahead and import the link component from react-router-dom.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.350
Now, down here, instead of rendering an anchor tag,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.960
let's render our link component and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.140
a link component will actually render an anchor tag still.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.195
We don't need an href,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:41.330
instead what we're going to give it is a to prop which is going to be a real URL.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.855
So we will say slash Create,

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:48.625
react router is going to do the work for us onClick so we can delete this right here,

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.135
and now, let's save this file.

00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:54.170
Now notice when we click on this link,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.870
we get taken to slash create,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.510
nothing else works yet because we haven't done everything

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.910
we need to in order to get to work,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.320
but we now have a browser router and we have our link and when we click on it,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.270
it updates the browser's URL.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.170
Now the last thing because we deleted are on navigate prompt.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.550
From our link component,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.130
we can come up here and delete it from here as well so we no longer destructure.
